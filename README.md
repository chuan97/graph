This was just a short fun challenge.

A single function to recursively partition a graph into a list of perfect clusters, with the adjacency matrix as input.

A perfect cluster is defined as a set of connected nodes that are completely isolated from the remaining nodes of the graph. All graphs are unions of one or more perfect clusters.
